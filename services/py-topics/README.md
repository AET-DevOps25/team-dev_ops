# NicheExplorer Topic Discovery Service

The Topic Discovery service is a specialized microservice focused on semantic clustering and topic labeling. It uses advanced machine learning algorithms (HDBSCAN) to discover meaningful research topics from cached embeddings and generates human-readable topic descriptions.

## 1 Â· Responsibilities in one glance
* **Semantic clustering** â€“ uses HDBSCAN algorithm on cached embeddings to find optimal topic clusters
* **Topic labeling** â€“ multi-strategy NLP approach to generate meaningful topic titles and descriptions
* **Batch processing** â€“ efficiently processes embeddings retrieved from GenAI service's ChromaDB cache
* **REST endpoints** â€“ exposes `/discover-topics-from-embeddings` for the proper microservices architecture

## ðŸ”„ Advanced Clustering Pipeline

> Note â€“ This service assumes embeddings are already generated and cached by the GenAI service. It focuses purely on clustering and topic discovery.

## 3 Â· Clustering algorithm (technical details)
1. **Embedding Retrieval** â€“ fetches cached embeddings from GenAI service by paper IDs
2. **Dimensionality Reduction** â€“ uses UMAP to reduce embeddings for optimal clustering
3. **Adaptive Clustering** â€“ HDBSCAN with dynamic parameters based on dataset size
4. **Topic Labeling** â€“ multi-strategy approach:
   * Title phrase extraction from paper titles
   * Technical term detection using regex patterns
   * TF-IDF analysis on meaningful n-grams
5. **Quality Filtering** â€“ removes noise and generic terms to ensure meaningful topics
6. **Ranking** â€“ sorts topics by clustering confidence and article count

---

## 4 Â· Configuration & performance
* **Lightweight container** â€“ uses `uv` package manager for fast builds
* **No AI dependencies** â€“ pure ML algorithms (scikit-learn, HDBSCAN, UMAP)
* **Adaptive parameters** â€“ clustering parameters adjust based on dataset size
* **Efficient processing** â€“ optimized for cached embeddings and batch operations

---

## 5 Â· Public endpoints
1. **POST `/discover-topics-from-embeddings`** â€“ main endpoint: takes paper metadata and IDs, returns semantic topics

---

## 6 Â· Topic quality features
* **Meaningful titles** â€“ extracts research areas like "Neural Networks", "Object Detection", "Image Segmentation"
* **Context-aware descriptions** â€“ generates descriptive text explaining the research focus
* **Technical accuracy** â€“ uses domain-specific patterns to identify computer science terminology
* **Relevance scoring** â€“ clustering confidence provides meaningful relevance scores (0-100)

This service ensures that topics are semantically meaningful and represent distinct research areas rather than generic keyword buckets.

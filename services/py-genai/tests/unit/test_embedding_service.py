def mock_embedding_service():

    Set up a fully mocked EmbeddingService for isolated unit testing.

    This fixture uses `unittest.mock.patch` as a context manager to temporarily
    replace external dependencies of the `EmbeddingService` with mock objects.
    This allows us to test the service's internal logic without making real
    network calls to Google or connecting to a Postgres database.

    The patches target the specific modules *as they are seen by the file under
    test* (`src.services.embedding_service`).

    Yields:
        A tuple containing:
        - service: An instance of `EmbeddingService` created with mocked dependencies.
        - fake_cur: A mock of the database cursor for asserting DB calls.
        - mock_google_embed: A mock of the Google embeddings client.
